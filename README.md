# AVJSnippets
Powershell snippets I frequently require for my scripts. Be my guest.

Copy the psm file to the script folder and use the following line to import it.
```
Import-Module "$((Get-Item $PSScriptRoot).FullName)\AVJSnippets.psm1"
```
Or simply cut and paste what you need from the module file.
